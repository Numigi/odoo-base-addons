Mass Mailing Unsubscribe From Portal
====================================
This module allows contacts to unsubscribe from mass mailing lists from the portal.

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
In vanilla Odoo, inside a mass mailing email template, it is possible to add a link
so that contacts can unsubscribe from the mailing list.

When clicking on the link, the contact is redirected to the unsubscribing page.

However, without the link inside the email,
it is not possible for the contact to access this page otherwise.

Usage
-----
As a partner connected to the portal, I notice a new menu entry.

When I click on the menu entry, the mailing list unsubscribe page is open.
