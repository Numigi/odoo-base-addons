Admin Light Mail Outlook
========================
This module extends Administration Light/Mail Servers rights to handle microsoft_outlook functionalities.
It manages access to the new Outlook fields and add them to the existing `Administration (Light) / Mail Servers`` right group.

As a user with `Administration (Light) / Mail Servers` rights.
I go to an incoming or outgoing email servers submenu of `Administration > Email`. I see that I have sufficient rights to access it.
