Admin Light Mail Outlook
========================
This module extends Administration Light/Mail Servers rights to handle `Microsoft Outlook Server` configuration.

As a user with `Administration (Light) / Mail Servers` rights.
I go to an incoming or outgoing email servers submenu of `Administration > Email`.
I see that I have sufficient rights to access to `Microsoft Outlook Server` configuration.
