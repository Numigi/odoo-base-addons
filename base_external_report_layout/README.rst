Base External Report Layout
===========================
.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
In vanilla Odoo, from the general settings, a many2one layout field allows you to select the layout of Qweb reports.
It allows you to select any view, including views that are not Qweb report layouts.


This field is modified when using the wizard behind 'Configure document layout'. If the user selects a view that is not a layout, then Qweb reports no longer work.

In order to avoid this scenario, this module allows to hide the external report layout field

Overview
--------
After installing this module, the field  `external_report_layout_id` is not anymore visible in the general settings view .
