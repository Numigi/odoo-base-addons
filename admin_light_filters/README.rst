Admin Light Filters
===================
This module adds user-defined filter management to the Admin Light user.

User Filter
-----------
A new group `Administration (Light) / Custom Filters` is added.

As a normal user (not the default admin) and member of that group, 
under the menu `Administration > User Interface > User-defined Filters`, I can :

* Delete a filter for which the Owner field is empty, or for which the Owner field has my user filled in
* Modify a filter for which the Owner field is empty, or for which the Owner field has my user filled in
* Access the 'Groups' and 'Users' fields allowing filters to be shared with users or groups of users.

Contributors
------------
* Numigi (tm) and all its contributors (https://bit.ly/numigiens)
